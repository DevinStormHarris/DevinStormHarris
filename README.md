## Welcome to my GitHub! 👋🏽

I'm Devin, and I'm a software engineer at Verana Health. Here, I build data extraction tooling to help scientists accelerate their medical research. My team uses AWS and the .NET ecosystem day-to-day, which encourages me to branch out and try new languages at home.

## This is what I'm currently working on.

This is a practice project I'm writing in python. I was inspired to do this particular project after my close friend and I discovered we forgot each other's birthday the past year, and talking about how many other birthdays we probably forgot. I chose python mainly to learn a new language, but also because of how simple this application is. I didn't want to over-engineer it.

## Outside of programming, I like to:

- read books. 📖 I read a ton of non-fiction and sci-fi, with sprinkles of other genres here and there. 
- drink coffee. ☕️ I use to be a barista, and my first week they had me drink every caffeinated drink on the menu. I've kept that pace up ever since.
- rock climb. 🧗🏽 It enables me to meet different kinds of people, lets me get outside and travel to new places.
- laugh at my cats. 🐈‍⬛ Zuzu and Cloudy are derps.
