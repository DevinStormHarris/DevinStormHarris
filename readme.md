## Welcome to my GitHub! 👋🏽

I’m a software engineer at Verana Health, where I am focused on building data extraction tools. I’m passionate about solving hard problems and growing my understanding around difficult topics. 

## Outside of programming, I like to:

- read books. 📖 I read a ton of non-fiction and sci-fi, with sprinkles of other genres here and there. 
- drink coffee. ☕️ I use to be a barista, and my first week they had me drink every caffeinated drink on the menu. I've kept that pace up ever since.
- rock climb. 🧗🏽 It enables me to meet different kinds of people, lets me get outside and travel to new places.
- laugh at my cats. 🐈‍⬛ Zuzu and Cloudy are derps.
